This is a simple recipes app with a basic CRUD and Rails API, created to demonstrate how to connect a Ruby on Rails back-end with a React front-end using ESbuild. This project helps you achieve the following learning objectives:

- Implement a connection between a Ruby on Rails back-end and a React front-end.
- Understand the pros and cons of different approaches for connecting Ruby on Rails with React.
- Understand how to use Webpack to bundle a React front-end with a Ruby on Rails back-end.

### Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

Before you can run the app, ensure you have the following prerequisites and configurations in place:

- **Ruby**: Verify that Ruby is installed on your machine by running `ruby -v` in your terminal. If not, download and install Ruby from the [official Ruby website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

- **Ruby on Rails**: Install the Ruby on Rails framework using the following command if you haven't already:

  ```bash
  gem install rails
  ```

- **Code Editor**: Use a code editor like Visual Studio Code (VSCode). If you don't have it, download it from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- **Git**: Make sure Git is installed and configured for version control. Download Git from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

- **PostgreSQL**: Install and properly configure PostgreSQL on your development server. We assumes the use of PostgreSQL as the default database. Download PostgreSQL from the [official PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
